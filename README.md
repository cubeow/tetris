Code for a minimal tetris game.
Developed on Unity.
If you are interested in recreating this, make sure to create 2 empty objects in your scene and name them SpawnManager and GameManager. Attach the corresponding scripts to it. Also make a prefab of a cube with the tag "cube" and add that to the public variable cube prefab in spawn manager script.
You are free to use this code
